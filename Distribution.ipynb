    "1. Symmetric Distribution: In this type, the data is evenly spread on both sides of a central point, creating a symmetrical shape when plotted. It often resembles a bell curve and is called a normal distribution.\n",

    "2. Skewed Distribution: When data points are not evenly distributed and are more concentrated on one side, it's called a skewed distribution. There are two types:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Positively Skewed (Right-skewed): The tail of the distribution points to the right.\n",
    "    - Negatively Skewed (Left-skewed): The tail of the distribution points to the left.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Bimodal Distribution: In some datasets, you might see two distinct peaks or modes. This is called a bimodal distribution. It suggests that there are two different groups or patterns within the data.\n",

    "1. Symmetry (Mirror) --  In a normal distribution, the mean, median, and mode are all the same and located at the center of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Bell-Shaped Curve -- The probability density function of a normal distribution forms a bell-shaped curve when plotted. The curve is highest (peak) at the mean and gradually decreases as you move away from the mean in either direction. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Single Peak -- Unlike some other distributions that may have multiple peaks (multimodal), the normal distribution has a single peak at its mean. SO unimodal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Asymptotic Tails -- The tails of the normal distribution extend infinitely in both directions, but they get closer and closer to the x-axis as you move away from the mean. This means that extreme values (far from the mean) are increasingly unlikely but still possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Constant Standard Deviation -- The spread or variability of a normal distribution is determined by its standard deviation (σ). In a standard normal distribution (with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1), about 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean, about 95% falls within two standard deviations, and about 99.7% falls within three standard deviations.\n",
